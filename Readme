# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for chronic kidney disease prediction using a synthetic dataset. It includes data generation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, along with a basic Streamlit application for demonstration.

## Project Contents

-   `chronic_kidney_disease_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.
-   `app.py`: The Streamlit application script for interactive predictions.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
-   `trained_models/`: Directory containing the saved trained machine learning models in `.joblib` format.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Make sure you have Python installed (3.6 or higher recommended).
3.  Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
